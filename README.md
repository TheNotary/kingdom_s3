# Kingdom S3

This repo is used for pushing assets into S3.  Things will be uploaded via aws_cli, and things will be downloaded in seperate apps via the same mechanism.

### Buckets

###### Secrets
I need to push a folder of secrets up to S3 so that it can easily be downloaded by my peers via various app setup scripts.

###### Static Site
I need to just prove that I can host a static site on S3 (possibly with cloudfront too??).
